Answer: When you want to use the HashMap.containsKey() method to check if the given item is contained by the map, 
after you override the equals() method, you also need to override the hashCode() method.

Fix it: 
@Override public int hashCode() {
	int nameHashCode = name.hashCode();
	return nameHashCode * salary;
}
